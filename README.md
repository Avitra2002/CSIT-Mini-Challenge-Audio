# CSIT-Mini-Challenge-Audio
## A Symphonic Cacophony

### Mission
This Mini Challenge focuseson audio data pre-processing. I had to complete 3 tasks that delve into the exciting domain of auto-driven AI. This domain has wide-ranging applications, such as transcribing spoken words into text, facilitating voice commands in virtual assistants, detecting emotional cues in human speed, identifying specific sounds.

### Task 1
"Santa possesses an extraordinary command of nearly all the world's languages, a total of almost 700... Yet, to his astonishment, he encountered an audio clip that appears entirely unfamiliar. This audio seemed to defy classification within any known language, which intrigues him. Is the audio of extraterrestrial origin, or an audio creation tailored specifically for him by the mystery challenge creator? Noting that this audio clip is unlike any foreign language that would require his efforts for translation, Santa now explores other basic audio manipulation techniques that are commonly used in the data science field.

Hints: • wonk uoy wonk uoy fl • The mystery creator is bad with numerical figures, so he would rather look at these numbers "geographically"... • We are looking for a place here! Submit 1 to 3 words for your answer."

### Task 2
"Santa has a keen ear for details. He is particularly great at detecting unusual sounds, especially when it is related to Christmas tules. Who else would be more familiar with Christmas songs than him? He came across a few intriguing audio files that seemed to weave the enchantment of Christmas with an unexpected twist... Among the jingle bells and cosy vibes, there is something odd - maybe birds. singing or a weird screech. Could it be a playful Christmas elf, blending holiday fun with a puzzle? The task is to find the message hidden among these quirky holiday music. 

Hints: 
• The clues may not always appear where you expect them to be. Keep your ears and eyes open, for hidden wonders often reveal themselves in the most unexpected places. 
• They say "a picture paints a thousand words". Indeed. Where is the picture you're supposed to look for? 
• We are looking for a time here! Give your answer in the form "HH:MM""

### Task 3
Recall that annoying static noise your TV used to emit when there is no signal? Santa hates that to the core! As monotonous as this audio clip may seem, Santa cannot help but wonder whether any voices are being drowned out amidst this cacophony. Santa vividly remembers a time when he had to shout at the top of his lungs to summon his reindeer amid the deafening noise of a passing train. 

Hints: • The deafening noise you hear now is commonly belicved to be inaudible to older individuals. 
• Santa's ears have aged, and they can no longer pick up soft voices effectively. 
• Remember we said Santa has command of almost all languages? Now it is finally time to use one, and of course it has to be kökenlerivle ilgili! • You are on the right track when you land on the lyrics to a well-known English song...take note of its title! 
• We are looking for an object here! Submit your answer as a single word. 

Learning Resources: 
• Here, have this broom... And clean up this mess of an audio clip!

Retaining audio data between 100Hz to 2000Hz should suffice to decipher the hidden message. In practice, applving the Fourier Transform to real world signals is not ideal. To delve into practical signal filtering, please explore windowing and Short-Time Fourier Transform.

It might get a little too soft after all the cleaning up...
